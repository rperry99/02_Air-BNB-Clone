## Some things to Concider

- This page was created using `npm create vite@latest`.
- Added images to the `public` folder. I am not entirely sure if this is the correct approach, but it was the only way I could get the images to load using props.
- This project was made to be displayed well at ~550px width for your screen. So this is **not** responsive.
  - The goal of this project was exclusively to learn how to use props, as well as creating components from an array of data. This was not a responsive design project.

## New things I learned from this.

- Props
- Creating components from an array of data.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
